# FAQ #

 ## If after making `posix_sitl`, Gazebo doesnâ€™t launch and gives you a error message regarding `geographiclib`##
 Do the following:
  * In your terminal type:  `sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-mavros ros-kinetic-mavros-extras`
  * When that installation is ready type: 
  * `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavlink/mavros/master/mavros/scripts/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh`
  * `./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh` (you might have to make the install_geographiclib_datasets.sh executable.)
